## Why Monotony?

We all have those moments when we feel tired, overwhelmed, or in need of a break from the usual grind. **Monotony** is my creative outlet for such times—when the clock ticks too slowly, when the routine feels never-ending, or when I simply need to wish someone something special but don’t know how. Instead of letting those moments pass by, **Monotony** lets me turn them into something new and exciting.
